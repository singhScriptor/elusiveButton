# Elusive Button

**Elusive Button** is a fun and interactive web application primarily built with JavaScript. It features two buttons: "Yes" and "No." When you click "Yes," you receive a welcome greeting. However, if you attempt to click "No," the button will elusively change its position before you can click it, providing a playful challenge.
